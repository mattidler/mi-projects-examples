# mi-projects-examples

This is a collection of my classroom assignments and my projects from Sierra College and Sacramento State. At Sierra College
I took Java and SQL as a normal part of the computer science offerings. The Python and C++ were part of the physics 
department catalog class offerings at Sacramento State. The focus was more on Scientific Computing for the python and C++, 
utilizing data and making useful graphs. 

Anything with a .dat was used in the C++ and Python code. The corresponding graphs that go with the data should be easy to 
follow. Text editors that I generally use are Sublime for both my Python and C++ code. For the Java I utilized jGrasp, and for 
SQl i just used PostgreSQL at the command line. 

Any feedback or suggestions are appreciated!
